## Topic 1

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*



Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r inita}
a <- 10
```

```{r filtered-flights, exercise = TRUE}
# Prepare a filtered nycflights to select February rather than January
b <- a * 12
```


```{r initb}
b = a*12
```



```{r arrange, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the sort order to Ascending
b*10
```



### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r prev, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "setupA", exercise.eval = T}
#y = 2 * x
#y
```



```{r exp, exercise = T}
# Experiment here
```




## Topic 2

### Some more
You can create matrices and arrays with [`matrix()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/matrix.html) and [`array()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/array.html), or by using the assignment form of [`dim()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/dim.html): We'll use `dim` in this walk through. See how to use `matrix` or `array` by typing `?matrix` or `?array` on your RStudio console.

```{r seq_init}
# Sequence of integers starting from 1 to 6
int_seq <- 1:6
```

```{r seq, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = T}
# Sequence of integers starting from 1 to 6
int_seq <- 1:6
```

For example, you can reorganize `int_seq` into a 2 Ã— 3 matrix (which has 2 rows and 3 columns):

```{r seq_dim, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = T}
dim(int_seq) <- c(2,3)

print(int_seq)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
